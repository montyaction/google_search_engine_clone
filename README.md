## Project Description

The Google Search Engine Clone is a web application that enables users to input search queries and retrieve results similar to those seen on Google. The project is built using React and Vite, ensuring a fast and efficient development process. This clone is designed for developers and students who want to understand how search engines work at a fundamental level and gain practical experience with front-end technologies.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter search queries in a search bar and view the results dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is optimized to work seamlessly across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Modular Component Structure**: The application is organized into reusable components, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Project Structure

- **Components**: Contains reusable UI components such as the search bar and results display.
- **Pages**: Contains different pages or views of the application.
- **StateProvider**: Manages the global state of the application, likely using React Context API or a similar state management tool.
- **API**: Handles API calls, possibly to a search engine backend or mock data source.
- **Dummy Data**: Used for testing and development, providing sample data for search queries.
- **Public**: Contains static assets like images and the main HTML file.
- **Src**: The main source directory where all the React components and application logic reside.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/montyaction/search_engine.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd search_engine
    ```
3. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start the application on a local development server. You can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build the project for production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

## Contribution Guidelines

    git push origin feature-name
    ```
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you’ve done and why it should be merged.

## Known Issues

- **Search Limitations**: The current implementation supports basic search functionality. Advanced features like filtering, sorting, and complex query handling are not yet implemented.
- **Real-Time Search**: While there is potential for real-time search as the user types, this feature may not be fully functional or optimized.

## To-Do List

- **Implement Advanced Search Features**: Add support for filters, sort options, and advanced query handling.
- **Improve Accessibility**: Ensure that the application is fully accessible, with features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Add Unit Tests**: Introduce unit testing for key components to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- **Enhance UI/UX**: Continuously improve the user interface and experience based on user feedback.

## Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the dynamic and responsive components of the application.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that provides fast development and optimized production builds.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code, ensuring code quality and consistency.
